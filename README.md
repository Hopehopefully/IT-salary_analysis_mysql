## 1. Overview
This section provides a high-level description of the project and its main objectives. It explains that the project focuses on cleaning and analyzing IT salary data from various companies, with a special emphasis on the European job market. The two key steps involved in the project are data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which work together to ensure that the dataset is ready for deeper insights. The goal is to generate meaningful conclusions based on salary trends, job positions, and other factors such as experience, company size, and gender.

## 2. Data Cleaning
This section outlines the methods and techniques used to clean the data before conducting any analysis:

Remove Duplicates: It explains how duplicate entries were identified and removed using SQL queries. Techniques like using window functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER()) help ensure that redundant records are removed, preserving the integrity of the dataset.

Handle Missing and Null Values: This part describes how missing values or null entries were dealt with. For instance, missing salary values or undefined job titles were either filled with appropriate default values, set to "Unknown," or rows were deleted to maintain a clean dataset.

Standardize Data: This step ensures that all data points follow a consistent format. For example, inconsistent salary formats or date representations were standardized to improve uniformity, and entries such as job titles or programming languages were standardized.

Remove Unnecessary Columns: Temporary or redundant columns that were only used during intermediate steps (e.g., row_num) were deleted to simplify the dataset and make it ready for analysis.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section describes the process of analyzing the cleaned data to uncover valuable insights:

General Overview of the Data: Describes the initial steps taken to understand the structure of the cleaned dataset, such as checking the total number of records, understanding the distribution of different job titles, or examining missing data. Queries might include summary statistics or basic aggregation.

Grouping and Aggregating Data: This part explains how the dataset was grouped by relevant categories (e.g., company, position, or gender) to compute aggregated values such as the average salary per position or the number of employees in each company. These insights help identify trends or outliers.

Temporal Analysis: Describes how the dataset was analyzed over time to track changes in salaries or job roles. For example, it might include an analysis of salary growth over the last year or the impact of economic conditions (like COVID-19) on salaries.

Ranking Companies by Layoffs: This section explains how companies were ranked based on the number of layoffs, helping to identify which companies had the highest and lowest layoffs, and revealing trends over time. It could be extended to show how layoffs correlate with salary changes or other variables.

## 4. Summary of Key Data Cleaning Steps
This section offers a quick summary of the critical actions performed during the data cleaning process:

Removing duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and deleted.
Standardizing and formatting data: Inconsistent data was corrected (e.g., formatting salary, positions, languages).
Handling missing or invalid data: Null and missing values were addressed by either filling or deleting them based on the context.
Dropping unnecessary columns: Temporary or irrelevant columns were removed to make the data ready for analysis.
## 5. Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes that the data is now cleaned and transformed, ready for further analysis. The cleaned dataset is prepared for deeper insights such as exploring salary trends, gender disparities, or the impact of experience on compensation. It also highlights that the repository serves as a foundation for anyone interested in analyzing IT salaries or conducting similar data analyses.
